# GPT2-Based Custom Chatbot for Cardiovascular Diseases, Treatment and Prevention.

Welcome to the GPT2-Based Custom Chatbot repository dedicated to cardiovascular health. This project leverages the powerful GPT-2 language model to create an intelligent chatbot designed to provide valuable insights, information, and support related to cardiovascular diseases, treatment options, and preventive measures.

## Key Features:
Conversational Expertise: The chatbot is powered by GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model, enabling natural and context-aware conversations on cardiovascular health topics.

Disease Understanding: With a vast knowledge base, the chatbot offers information about various cardiovascular diseases, their symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic procedures.

Treatment Insights: Users can engage in discussions about different treatment modalities, medications, surgical interventions, and lifestyle modifications for managing cardiovascular conditions.

Preventive Guidance: The chatbot is equipped to provide advice on preventive measures, lifestyle choices, and habits that contribute to heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

# Example Prompts and Responses

## Using the Trained Model

### Prompt 1:
**Prompt:** [Q] Provide information about the role of genetics in heart health?

**Response:** [A] Genetics can influence the risk of heart disease; individuals with a family history may have a higher predisposition.

### Prompt 2:
**Prompt:** [Q] Explain the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases?

**Response:** [A] Factors such as genetics, diet, exercise, and stress can contribute to cardiovascular diseases.

### Prompt 3:
**Prompt:** [Q] What are the symptoms of a heart attack?

**Response:** [A] Symptoms of a heart attack may include chest pain, fatigue, swelling in the legs, or difficulty breathing.

### Prompt 4:
**Prompt:** [Q] What is the connection between gum disease and heart health?

**Response:** [A] Gum disease has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease; maintaining good oral hygiene may contribute to cardiovascular health.

### Prompt 5:
**Prompt:** [Q] How is a pacemaker used in treating heart rhythm disorders?

**Response:** [A] A pacemaker is a device implanted in the chest to regulate heart rhythm by emitting electrical impulses to control heartbeat when the natural electrical system is faulty.

### Prompt 6:
**Prompt:** [Q] How does diabetes contribute to the development of heart conditions?

**Response:** [A] Diabetes can damage blood vessels, increase the risk of heart disease, and increase the risk of cardiovascular events; managing blood sugar levels is important for heart health.

### Prompt 7:
**Prompt:** [Q] Describe the role of anticoagulant medications in cardiovascular treatment?

**Response:** [A] Anticoagulants help prevent blood clots, reducing the risk of stroke and other complications in individuals with certain heart conditions.

### Prompt 8:
**Prompt:** [Q] What is the impact of secondhand smoke on heart health?

**Response:** [A] Exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease by affecting blood vessels and promoting the development of atherosclerosis.
